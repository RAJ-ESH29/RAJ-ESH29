- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rajesh Kumar Singh from India.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in doing coding. Earlier I started coding in C++ and now from last 2 years I am coding in Java. I believe language doesn't bring too much change, as long as you are ready for a change.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding in Java language in depth and is always ready to learn.
